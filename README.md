Inspired by freeCodeCamp's [Build a Random Quote Machine](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine) project. This version of the project uses pure HTML, CSS and JS â€” no frameworks, no libraries, no SASS. All quotes are hard-coded in main.js.


## Requirements
- [x] It should be horizontally centered on the page.
- [x] It should display a random quote when the page loads.
- [x] It should display the name of the quote's movie when the page loads.
- [x] When the "New random quote" button is clicked, it should fetch a new quote and display it.
- [x] When the "New random quote" button is clicked, it should fetch the new quote's movie and display it.
- [x] It should provide a way for the user to tweet the current quote.
